### Feedback for the SwedBank Pay API/Payment integration

## Usage
- The Documentation seems a little frustration and not that easy to understan what to do. 



## My recommendations
- Make more dropdowns in the documentation pages, so that only the "important" documentation shows
- I would like to see more full functional examples in other languages and frameworks
    - Node.JS (Express)
    - React
    - Vue
- Examples for Callback 
    - Check if payment was succeded
